        <h3>As we are on the road most of the time touring with our riders or exploring new routes, we may not always be in immediate contact.
            We have therefore compiled as much relevant information as possible to help you get ready for your upcoming adventure!</h3>

                        <p>Confirmed bookings for which we have received a deposit or full payment before 23 March 2020, will be secured should you decide it is unsafe to travel or cannot travel.

                            Bookings can be rescheduled up to 18 months from the original tour start date. Please note only one amendment to travel dates may be made.
                            
                            In the event that you do not travel within 18 months of the original tour start date, the deposit paid would be forfeited – assuming the Corona Epidemic has been contained by then and it is possible to travel. Any payments beyond the deposit will be refunded minus any fees associated with your payment and the subsequent refund.
